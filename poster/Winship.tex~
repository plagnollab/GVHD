        \begin{block}{Graft versus host disease}
     \begin{itemize}
          \item In malignant pathologies the donor immune system recognises tumour cells as foreign and eradicates them via immunological mechanisms which together are known as the graft vs tumour (GVT) effect
          \item Donor immune cells may also attack normal host tissue resulting in acute graft vs host disease (GVHD)
          \item The skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract are the most common tissues to be damaged in GVHD
          \item GVHD remains one of the most common post-transplant complications and represents a major barrier to the successful application of allo-HSCT
	  \item A major risk factor involved in GVHD pathology is the use of HLA-mismatched, non related donors
          \item Acute GVHD involves alloreactive donor T-cell mediated cytotoxic response to the tissues of the recipient
          \item Tissue damage caused by cytotoxic T cells leads to recruitment of other effector cells including natural killer cells which further increases tissue injury and results in self perpetuating GVHD
          \item Mice represents the primary model animal for pre-clinical studies of GVHD
          \item Mouse models of acute GVHD usually involve a bone marrow transplant (BMT) which is supplemented with varying numbers/types of donor lymphocites into irradiated allogenic recipients who differ from donors in their MHC class 1 and/or class 2 molecules or in minor histocompatibility antigens
          \end{itemize} 
        \end{block}


        \begin{block}{The ImmGen project}
          \begin{itemize}
          \item The primary aim of ImmGen project is to be comprehensive definition of gene expression and regulatory networks in cells of the mouse immune system
          \item Genes are grouped into modules according to similarities in expression profiles 
          \item Immgen coarse modules consist of groups of genes with broadly similar expression profiles while fine modules represent more defined collections of genes with a high degree of similarity in the expression patterns
	  \item By comparing differentially expressed gene sets to ImmGen, it is possible to identify expression level changes of potentially biologically relevant pathways within the data
          \end{itemize}
