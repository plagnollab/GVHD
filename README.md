#Key question

How do we demonstrate that the tissue interaction is the dominant factor in GVHD?
Can we separate the tissue signature from the lymph node priming?


# GVL work

## Matahari model

### Dataset 1: T-cells exposed to stroma with or without antigen.

Performed using a knock-out model (MHC1 absent)
TM008 (D7) and TM006 (D42) datasets

## Human model

Data not yet ready

# GVHD work

## Matahari model

### Dataset 2: T-cells with or without exposure to Langerhans cells


### Dataset 3: Langerhans cell data

Difficult to interpret dataset, no major differences across types.


## Human data



# Why Langerhans cells

APC cells, radio-resistant they therefore stay and self-renew, and present host antigens.
Depletion of LC in mataHari leads to less GVHD in the skin, and fewer T-cells from the donors infiltrating the epidermis.
Field is mixed on the role of LC.

Seminal paper Merad, based in Rockefeller, LC are sufficient to drive GVHD.
View that in the skin, interaction betwen TC and LC is what drives GVHD.
Each tissue may have a different signature, and the headline is that not the priming but subsequent events is what matters, interaction within each tissue.
