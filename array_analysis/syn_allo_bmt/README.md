# Single minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched BMT model (MataHari female  B6 male)

Objective: Evaluate the differences in gene expression of Langerhans cells in the setting of an allogeneic BMT or a syngeneic BMT.

Expression arrays performed on flow sorted Langerhans cells.

Groups:

+ Allogeneic BMT recipients (bone marrow B6 female donor & T cells from MataHari female donor  B6 male recipient, 3 arrays)

+  Syngeneic BMT recipients (bone marrow & T cells from B6 female donor  B6 female recipient, 3 arrays)

+  Untreated recipient (B6 male, 3 arrays)

None of these groups seem to show any excess of P-values.
