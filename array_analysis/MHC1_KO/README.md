# Multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched BMT model (B6 -> 129sv and MataHari female -> B6 male)


## TM006wt_vs_TM006ko

In a polyclonal model, evaluate the differences in gene expression of effector T cells found in the lymphoid organs or in the peripheral tissues.

Histogram of P-values show an increase of low Ps, suggesting that a signal is captured by this experiment.


## TM008wt_vs_TM008ko

In a monoclonal model, evaluate the differences in gene expression of effector T cells found in the lymphoid organs or in the peripheral tissues.
